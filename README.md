# ૮ ․ ․ ྀིა Melika Khodabin

Hi! I’m Melika, a Data Quality Engineer with a humanities heart, a science-fiction imagination, and a curiosity that never sits still.  
I build data-quality systems at **Snapp!**, where large-scale data meets human behavior.  
Before engineering, I studied Journalism (B.A.) and Japanese Studies – Media & Culture (M.A.), and I still love blending media studies with computation.

## 🎓 Academic & Research
I write and publish about AI literacy, media, and digital culture.  
- **Google Scholar:** https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ERGMdMAAAAJ
