# ૮ ․ ․ ྀིა Melika Khodabin

Hi! I’m Melika, a Data Quality Engineer with a humanities heart, a science-fiction imagination, and a curiosity that never sits still.  
I build data-quality systems at **Snapp!**, where large-scale data meets human behavior.  
Before engineering, I studied Journalism (B.A.) and Japanese Studies – Media & Culture (M.A.), and I still love blending storytelling with computation.

## 🎓 Academic & Research
I write and publish about AI literacy, media, and digital culture.  
- **Google Scholar:** https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ERGMdMAAAAJ

## ✨ Tech & Tools
Python · SQL (ClickHouse, Postgres, T-SQL) · Great Expectations · Streamlit · Pandas · Spark · S3/MinIO · Docker · GitLab CI/CD

## ヾ( ˃ᴗ˂ )◞ What I enjoy  
- Building clean, reliable data systems ✨  
- Playing with modeling systems 🧩  
- Exploring digital culture, AI literacy, and the future of media 📡  
- Researching (and sometimes publishing) about technology, education, and society 📚  
- Learning languages (English B2, French B1, Japanese A2, Persian native) 🗣️  
- Listening to good music while working, studying, and reading 🎶  
- Creating things that help people understand complex systems more easily 🔍  
- Traveling 🌎  

## 🌍 A little more about me
I live in Tehran.  
I’m an **INFP**, which means I mix logic with intuition, engineering with imagination, and Python scripts with philosophical midnight thoughts.  
I love David Attenborough documentaries.  
My favorite music bands are Soen, Katatonia, Opeth, and RADWIMPS.  
My favorite travel destinations are Qeshm and Hormoz islands.  
I stand for equity and justice, and strongly reject antisemitism and neo-Nazism.
